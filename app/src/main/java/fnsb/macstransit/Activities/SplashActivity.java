	 * Called as part of the activity lifecycle when the user no longer actively interacts with the activity,

	 * When activity B is launched in front of activity A, this callback will be invoked on A.
	 * B will not be created until A's onPause() returns, so be sure to not do anything lengthy here.
	 * <p>
	 * This callback is mostly used for saving any persistent state the activity is editing,
	 * to present a "edit in place" model to the user and making sure nothing is lost if there are not enough resources to start the new activity without first killing this one.
	 * This is also a good place to stop things that consume a noticeable amount of CPU in order to make the switch to the next activity as fast as possible.

	 * <p>
	 * If an activity is launched on top,
	 * after receiving this call you will usually receive a following call to onStop() (after the next activity has been resumed and displayed above).
	 * However in some cases there will be a direct call back to onResume() without going through the stopped state.
	 * An activity can also rest in paused state in some cases when in multi-window mode, still visible to user.

	 * Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation of this method.
