 * <i><b>Yo dawg. I heard you like static methods. So I got you some static methods, so you could static method while you static method :D</b></i>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Ok, I've had my fun.</i>
 * <p>
 * But in all seriousness, all of these methods are static, but only one is public,
 * and is to be used outside this class as a result.
 * The reason why all the other methods exist is simply for more easy of use within the primary method.
 * The reason for this is because this class is used to actually connect to a server via the provided url.
 * Since android doesn't like url connections to be run on the UI thread, this needs to be done on its own thread.
 * Hence the complexity :(
